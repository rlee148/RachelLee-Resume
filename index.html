        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Rachel Lee and I am currently a sophomore at UC Riverside. I am majoring in Economics, specifically Business Administration, and gained interest in this field through my parents. My parents had their own business for about ten years, and growing up with parents who worked in this field allowed me to have a passion for business. Although their business is no longer running, I wanted to learn more about this field in order to achieve my goals. 
I am currently working at a business located at the Fashion District in Downtown Los Angeles to gain experience and learn more about how business works in the fashion industry. The reason why I have decided to work in the fashion industry is because my interests lean more towards fashion than any other business. Although it has only been a few months since I started working, I can already see how much I learned and grew through this opportunity! My job there is to help process orders, shipping labels, customer service, wholesale, and inventory. Doing an office job isnâ€™t my ultimate goal, but watching how my boss does business really allows me to learn how competitive it may get, and how easily it is to lose money through the greeds of other business partners. 
Currently, I began planning how I want to start my business through the help of mentors I met through my job, and I am excited to launch my own brand. I am expecting trial and error throughout the process, but I believe that Iâ€™ll be able to grow through my mistakes and eventually become stronger. Iâ€™m not too sure what products I want to present to consumers, but one thing I really want to present is clothes. Throughout my years as a teenager, I have realized that many clothing brands were raising prices of clothes with very low quality in material, and I wanted to change that. I want to be able to provide clothes that students can afford, and I also want to provide clothing options that may be beneficial to the environment. There are so many things that I want to provide through my clothing brand, and there may be times where Iâ€™ll be at a loss. But these will all be trials and errors I will need to go through in order to make both me and my consumers happy. 
To be completely honest, I had zero interest in this field until I became a senior in high school. Before I decided to attend UC Riverside, I wanted to attend University of the Pacific located in Northern California. I wanted to attend this school because I initially wanted to become an orthodontist. This dream rooted from the orthodontist that I had growing up. I still remember the smile he had whenever he removed braces off of students. He used to take before and after pictures of his patients, and he made sure to take a picture of them smiling at the very end. He would be looking at the pictures on his camera, and he always looked extremely happy with what he was doing. Seeing this, I wanted to become an orthodontist, but I looked deep down in my heart and realized that this was mainly rooted from my momâ€™s greed as well. Growing up, my mom has always told me that there was no other job better than working in the medical field, and because of this, I was always searching for a career in the medical field other than what I wanted to do. As a child, it was extremely stressful because I felt like my parents were against everything I wanted to do. Even though I knew that they were saying these things for my sake, I did not want to wake up miserably to a job that I didnâ€™t enjoy doing. Therefore, I decided to attend UC Riverside to study business and achieve my goals, and dreams. 
Before my job as an office worker in the fashion industry, I had multiple part time jobs in high school. I had the chance to work at a smoothie shop, and a boba store. I believe that these two jobs were able to help me learn organizational skills, as well as communication skills. Organization skills are important, especially because Iâ€™m working with inventory and many orders. Communication skills are also very important, since I am dealing with customers through emails and phone calls. There are many responsibilities that I have because of this job, but I did not think it was too difficult for me to handle because I was born as the first child in the family. Being the first child in my family gave me many responsibilities, and it is still one of my biggest stresses to this day. Because I am labeled as the first child, I have the responsibility of being a good example to my younger brother. I also have the responsibility of taking care of him, and all the pets we have in our house. I was also the first child in an immigrant family to be sent off to college, so there were many sacrifices that had to be made. Both of my parents attended school in college, so they did not know anything about college apps or financial aid. They did not know a single thing about what was required, so they gave me the responsibility of figuring out on my own. While all of my friends had tutors for SATâ€™s and ACTâ€™s, I had to study on my own through the help of workbooks, and while they had tutors to look over their college essays, I had to work through them on my own. I also had the responsibility to help my parents call their banks, insurance companies, and other companies because they are not fluent in English. These responsibilities may have been one of my biggest stressors in life, but I believe that they helped me to mature faster and learn skills that are needed in my future.
Having these stressors in life did affect me emotionally, mentally, and physically. There were many times when I felt like I wasnâ€™t living my own life, especially because I felt like I was born to achieve goals that my mom wasnâ€™t able to achieve on her own as a kid. I had many times when I felt like giving up, but my friends were able to keep me stable and going by introducing me to Christianity. I grew up in a family that had no religion, but visiting a church was a life changing experience. Becoming a Christian means so much to me because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be the person I am today if I was never introduced to it. Christianity opened my eyes to many things in the world, and it also helped me have the positive mindset I have today. It comforts me so much that there are many people going through trials in life, and that they are saved through their belief in Christianity. Being able to witness this at church, and through missions around the world puts me at awe for how different my life has become after becoming a Christian. 
 I also had the opportunity to audition for a Christian dance team which also helped me to develop an interest in music. Dancing on stage, I realized how happy I was, and it also allowed me to realize that I am able to be this happy by doing what I want to do. I never felt such emotions and happiness in my life, being able to dance on the same stage as my friends. Being able to be a part of this dance team helped me to develop my personality that I have today, and it also helped me develop better social skills. Music is now one of my biggest passions in life, and I want to apply this to my business as well! Dancing on this team, I was able to witness many things about media because we had a media team that filmed all practices, stages, and concerts since it was a well-known dance team. This dance team exists in several countries like South Korea, China, Texas, Australia, and many more. Therefore, I also developed an interest in media through the videos that were produced by teams all around the world. Media means a lot of things, but for me personally, I developed an interest in graphics, video footage, and pictures. The pictures that were presented by the dance teamâ€™s media team let me realize that one picture alone can express many different emotions to the person looking at the picture. Although I do not know much about media at the moment, I am continuously studying to learn more about it through opportunities that are available to me. I was given the opportunity to create graphics for a club at my school, and I was also given the opportunity to witness photoshop skills at my current job. Therefore, I am hoping to use these skills in life.
